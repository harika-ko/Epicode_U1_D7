/* EXERCISE 1
 Enumerate and describe the main datatypes in JavaScript. Try to explain the concepts as you were speaking to a 12 years old.
*/

/*There are Primitive Types which contains Number, Strings, Boolean, Undefined, Null, BigInt and Symbol. 

Numbers-> They can contain anything between -(2e53-1) and +(2e53-1)
There are special values such as +Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.

Strings-> They are sequence of characaters which can be depicted as "",'' and ``.

Boolean-> Contains the value which is either True or False.

Undefined-> Value that does not exist.

Null-> Empty value which is a variable containing nothing.

There are Structural Types which contains Objects and Functions.

Objects-> They are the collection of Key-Value properties.

Functions-> Functions are a block of code that can be executed.*/


/* EXERCISE 2
 Try to describe what a variable is, in your own words.
*/

/* Variable is a container to which any value can be assigned. */

/* EXERCISE 3
 Write the code to execute an addition (a sum) of the numbers 12 and 20.
*/

console.log(12 + 20)

/* EXERCISE 4
 Create a variable named x and assign to it the number 12.
*/

let x
x = 12

/* EXERCISE 5
 Create a variable called name and assign to it the string "John Doe".
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 6
 Execute a subtraction between the number 12 and the variable x you declared before (which is storing the value 12).
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 7
 Create two variables: name1 and name2. Assign to name1 the string "john", and to name2 the string "John" (this one has a capital J!)
 Verify that name1 is different from name2 (HINT: check their equality to be false).
 Finally, verify that the equality between name1 and name2 becomes true if both are lowercase (without changing the value of name2).
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 8
 Create a variable named x, and assign to it a numeric value less than 10.
 Write the code to print the literal value of x (ex.: if x is 1, it should print "one", if x is 5 it should print "five" etc.).
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 9
 [Extra] Assign a value to a variable using a ternary operator (this topic has not been covered during lesson yet,
 try to search it by yourself, tomorrow morning we'll discuss it together!)
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED
 Upload the .js file on Eduflow before 5PM CET. In the next days we'll also learn how to use GIT!
